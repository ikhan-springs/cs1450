# CS 1450

This repository contains my Java programming assignments for the course CS 1450: Data Structures and Algorithms.

CS 1450 includes concepts of data type/abstraction/structure, internal representations of fundamental data types, linear data structures (stack, queue), linked data structures, dynamic data types, search table data abstraction, linear search in arrays and lists, binary search in arrays and trees, binary trees, non-binary trees, and binary search trees.

I completed this course at UCCS in May 2020. A brief description of the outcome of each project is given below. A more detailed description can be found at the top of each program file.
